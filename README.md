## Description

The goal of this application is to build a content management system for employees in a company.

## Usage

This application can be used to display lists information on departments, roles and employees from a company stored in a mySQL database. The information can be accessed and added or modified from the terminal.

## What I did

I built a program that uses the inquirer node package to access, add, and modify company information from a mySQL database. The information is displayed in an organized manner using the console.table node package.

## What I learned

I learned about how to access and modify mySQL databases.
